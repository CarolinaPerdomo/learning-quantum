# Shor's Algorithm

- Core algo - can be implemented using classical algorithms only (for learning).  
- Optimization techniques are key to both classical and quantum implementations of Shor's Algorithm.

## What is it?

- Problem: Given an odd integer N, find its prime factors (p,q)
- Uses 'Period Finding' 
- The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings

This hints us that such exponents may have periods.
