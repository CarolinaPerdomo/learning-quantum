# Shor's Algorithm

- Core algo - can be implemented using classical algorithms only (for learning).  
- Optimization techniques are key to both classical and quantum implementations of Shor's Algorithm.

## What is it?

- Problem: Given an integer N, find its prime factors
- The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings
