# Quantum Computing Languages and Libraries

- There are a growing nubmer of quantum computing languages and libraries.    
- Many of these languages are designed to run on a particular vendor's environment.    
- This includes cloud vendors - see this [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/CLOUD-VENDORS.md)
