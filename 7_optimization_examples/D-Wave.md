## Not-All-Equal 3-Satisfiability (NAE3SAT)

From this Repo --> https://github.com/dwave-examples/NAE3SAT. 

Explantion (from Repo): "NAE3SAT is an NP-complete Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem that has clauses of three literals each and requires that for every clause the literals are not all equal to each other; i.e., all configurations are valid except (-1, -1, -1) and (+1, +1, +1) (for spin-valued variables, or (0,0,0) and (1, 1, 1) for binary-valued variables)."
