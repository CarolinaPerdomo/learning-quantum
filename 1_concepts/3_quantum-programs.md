# Quantum Programs

Types of problems for QPUs include cryptography, search, system simulations, general machine learning, computational biology, and generative chemistry.  

- **Hello World(s)** --> entangle 2 or more qubits and read the result from the histogram of the shots run - runnable example on `quantum-inspire` - [link](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/hello-quantum-world/)
  - H and CNOT to entangle
  - READ to get value

- **Random Number Generator** --> entangle 2 or more qubits and read the results
  - H and CNOT to entangle
  - READ to get value

- **Shor's Algorithm** --> factoring problem
  - H and CNOT to entangle
  - AA and QFT

- **MNIST using a QNN** --> digit classification using a quantum neural network
  - H and CNOT to entangle
  - AA and QFT
