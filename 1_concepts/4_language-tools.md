# QPUs, Quantum Languages and Viz Tools

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/1_concepts/images/ibm-qpus.png" width=200 align=right>

- QPUs are available from major cloud and specialty vendors, such as IBM, Google, D-Wave and others.  Shown to the right is a quantum computer built by IBM
- Each vendor's implementation of QPUs differs.  To that end, there are a number of quantum programming languages, libraries and simuators which you will use when writing quantum programs
- There are several catagories of quantum programming: learning/teaching, public cloud or specialty cloud

## Learning/Teaching Quantum Languages and Visualization Tools

The table below shows a sampling of available Quantum programming teaching libraries and visualization tools.
