# QPUs, Quantum Languages and Viz Tools

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/1_concepts/images/ibm-qpus.png" width=200 align=right>

- QPUs are available from major cloud and specialty vendors, such as IBM, Google, D-Wave and others.  Shown to the right is a quantum computer built by IBM
- Each vendor's implementation of QPUs differs.  To that end, there are a number of quantum programming languages, libraries and simuators which you will use when writing quantum programs

## Languages

The table below shows a sampling of available Quantum programming languages or libraries.

| Lang or Lib| Dialect  | Vendor    | Simulators   |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| QCEngine   | Javascript | book    |none          |
| Q#         | C#       | Microsoft |local+Azure   |
| OpenQASM   | C++      | IBM       |IBM cloud     |
| Qiskit     | Python   | IBM       |IBM cloud     |
| Cirq       | Python   | Google    |GCP (vendor)  |
| Braket     | Python   | AWS       |3 local by type|
| PennyLane  | Python| PennyLane for ML on AWS++    |by vendor |
