STATUS: PRIVATE BETA or SIMULATORS or PARTNERS

Google has a number of quantum services, tools and libraries under the umbrella of [Google Quantum AI](https://quantumai.google/), including these:
- **Quantum Computing Service** (currently in private beta) - QPUs on GCP, screenshot from GCP documentation shown below
- **Cirq** - Python-like quantum programming library, includes software quantum simulators (qsim) for testing your qunatum programs
- **TensorFlow Quantum** - quantum library (uses QPUs) for TensorFlow (implements QCNNs, or quantum convolutional neural networks) - [tutorial](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/06/training-with-multiple-workers-using-tensorflow-quantum.html)
