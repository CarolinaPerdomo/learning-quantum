This repo contains my study resources for learning quantum computing programming.  Shown to the left is a conceptual rendering of a bit vs a qubit, which is a fundamental concept or work in quantum computing.  A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.

## Hardware Example

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/images/d-wave-hardware.png" width=600 align=right>

There are a number of quantum computing vendors.  They produce hardware which container qubits for quantum computing programming execution via QPUs.   

One example is the [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/) company.  Shown here is one of their QPU units, which is hardware with qubits (image taken from D-Wave whitepaper).
