This repo contains my study resources for learning quantum computing programming.  Shown to the left is a conceptual rendering of a bit vs a qubit, which is a fundamental concept or work in quantum computing.    

A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. 

This Repo is organized by folder as follows:
- `concepts` - quantum languages, libraries, operations and notation
- `cloud-vendors` - quantum runtime environments (and simulators) organized by cloud vendor
- `whitepapers` - academic research papers of interest using quantum programming
- `o-reilly-book` - code examples, slides and link from bookclub (see section below)

## QPUs - Quantum Hardware 

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/images/d-wave-hardware.png" width=600 align=right>

There are a number of quantum computing vendors.  They produce hardware (quatum computers) which contain a particular number of qubits.    

The qubits are used by quantum computing programming languages or libraries for execution with QPUs.   

One example is the [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/) company.  Shown here are photos from one of D-Wave's quantum computers.  This computer contains QPU units, which is hardware with qubits (image taken from D-Wave whitepaper).

## Quantum Programs - Visualization Tools

Sample from IBM Quantum Composer examples.  Example shown below is the `Grover-example`.  
Another example of a quantum program visualizaiton tools is the `Quantum Playground` - http://www.quantumplayground.net/
