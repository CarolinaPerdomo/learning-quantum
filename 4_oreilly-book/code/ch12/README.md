## What is it?

- Given an integer N, find its prime factors (p,q) in **polynomial time** 
    - NOTE: although you could use classical algorithms to factor the product of two primes, it requires superpolynomial time to do so for large numbers
    - By definition N must be an ODD integer
    - By definition p, q can NOT be equal to ONE  
- The algorithm is composed of two parts
    - **Classical part** -  turns the factoring problem into the problem of finding the period of a function 
    - **Quantum speedup** -  finds the period using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings
        -  Uses QFT to 'learn' the function's periodicity 
        -  Also called 'period finding' in polynomial time
- Why does it matter? 
    - RSA public-key encryption (and other methods) rely on the current INABILITY to quickly factorize large numbers
    - Being able to quickly determine the *complex periodicity* of a function has a number of potential applications

- This theorem gives us the hint that such exponents may have periods.  Potential factors are determined using classical methods, potential periods are found using quantum methods.
